                    The state flower of Hawaii is the yellow hibiscus, also known as Pua Aloalo or Hibiscus brackenridgei. This vibrant yellow flower was designated as the official state flower in 1988. The yellow hibiscus is native to Hawaii and can be found growing in the wild on several of the Hawaiian islands. The plant is notable for its large, bright blooms and is a symbol of the tropical beauty and unique natural heritage of the Hawaiian Islands.
